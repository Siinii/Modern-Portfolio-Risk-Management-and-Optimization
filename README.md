# Modern Portfolio Risk Management and Optimization

This project combined aspects of Linear Algebra, Statistics, and Optimization in order to generate ideal portfolio weights given a list of desired stocks.

The goal of the algorithm is to find the optimized weightage of a portfolio which maximizes returns while still satisfying some investor's risk tolerance.

This project was done as a part of Computational Mathematics for Computer Science (CS 3220) at Cornell University.
